# Friend Lamps
 A project built to keep you in touch with the people you love from miles away. 
 ## About the Project 
 The aim of this project is to help maintain connections with people remotely. With the never ending pandemic, it is difficult to meet your loved ones. This project allows for an ease in expression of your emotions without using words. 

 The lamp has an Arduino RGB LED module that enables the user to switch between green, blue and red colours. To do this, a server is designed to control the colours between both lamps with a sync span of 2 minutes.
