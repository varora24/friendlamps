# Friend Lamps
 A project built to keep you in touch with the people you love from miles away. 
 ## About the Project 
 The aim of this project is to help maintain connections with people remotely. With the never ending pandemic, it is difficult to meet your loved ones. This project allows for an ease in expression of your emotions without using words. 

 The lamp uses a NodeMCU with an Arduino RGB module to sync colours between 2 remote lamps through a firebase database. The lamps check the server every 2 minutes (frequency can be changed to make it realtime) and the users can access a custom website to change the colour in the server with a choice of red, blue and green. 
 
 The code is modular and if you would like to make  one for yourself,the instructions are below. Have fun!
